# What's this?

This is a set of examples developed with the sole purpose of teaching my brother some key concepts about "modern" frontend development. He's just starting with it and naturally is having a lot of questions about everything, so I'm keeping this examples here just for the record...

## Examples

### Todo List App

```bash
npm run start:todo-list
```

### Async Iterators to interact with the DOM through streams

```bash
npm run start:dom-async-iterators
```
